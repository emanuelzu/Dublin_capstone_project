# Dublin_capstone_project

Capstone Project for Data Science Certification

Mr. John Guinness, a software developer, found a new job in Dublin and decided to move there. He is interested to rent an apartment. Where are the best places for him to leave? Which districts in Dublin best fit his preferences?

We asked Mr. Guinness to provide a list of his preferences. Here it is: theaters, parks, beaches, gyms, public transportation, pubs, restaurants (especially Italian and Chinese), coffee shops, shopping malls, supermarkets, groceries and convenience shops.

There are 22 districts in Dublin. In order to answer Mr. Guinness questions, we have to look for the most relevant venues for each district in Dublin, we have to group the districts regarding the categories of venues in Mr. Guinness' preferences list and, finally, we have to find the group of districts which best matches his preferences.
