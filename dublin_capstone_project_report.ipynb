    "\n",
    "Dublin, the capital and the largest city of Ireland, is situated on a bay of the North Atlantic Ocean and is bordered by the Dublin Mountains on the south. With an estimate of 50% of its citizens being younger than 25, Dublin is, for sure, one of the most youthful cities in Europe. Companies such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Citigroup, PayPal, Facebook, Twitter have European headquarters or operational bases there. As a consequence, Dublin is sometimes referred to as the new \"Tech Capital of Europe\".\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, Dublin is known for its many pubs across the city. When speaking about nightlife, the best known area among tourists is the Temple Bar Neighborhood. The area is also known for its street performers and small live music venues. Other areas like those around Leeson Street, Harcourt Street, South William Street or Camden Street are popular among locals. When speaking about cuisine, there were five restaurants in 2018 in Dublin which shared six Michelin stars: Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud had two stars and there were four other restaurants with one star each (according to the Michelin Guide).

The agglomerative clustering algorithm performs a hierarchical clustering using a bottom up approach: pairs of clusters are merged together as they move up the hierarchy.\n",

    "Having a data set with n data points, the algorithm starts by assigning each data point to its own cluster. The next step is to look for the closest two clusters one to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "We construct a distance matrix where the ij element in the matrix is the distance between the i and j data points, with i,j = 1,...,n. The distance matrix contains the distances from each point to every other point of the dataset.   \n",
    "\n",
    "At each iteration, the algorithm updates the distance matrix to reflect the distance of the newly formed cluster with the remaining clusters in the set. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps of the algorithm are as follows:\n",
    "* create n clusters and assign one for each data point. \n",
    "* compute the distance matrix.\n",
    "* repeat:\n",
    "  * merge the two closest clusters.\n",
    "  * update the distance matrix.\n",
    "* until only a single cluster remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different approaches to calculate the distance between clusters and they define different  paradigms:\n",
    "* Single linkage clustering, where the minimum distance between data points in the two clusters is calculated.\n",
    "* Complete linkage clustering, where the maximum distance between data points in the two clusters is calculated.\n",
    "* Average linkage clustering: where the average distance between data points in the two clusters is calculated.\n",
    "* Centroid linkage clustering: where the distance between the two clusters centroids is calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm can be visualized building a dendrogram. Each merge of clusters is a horizontal line in the dendrogram and the *y* coordinate of the horizontal line represents the similarity of the two clusters that were merged. The dendrogram allows us to reconstruct the history of merges in the clustering process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why did we chose the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm? First of all, the algorithm produces a dendrogram which can help to better understand the data and how the clusters were built. Second, our data set is a small one, therefore we do not need a more efficient algorithm. Finally, the algorithm always generates the same clusters."
